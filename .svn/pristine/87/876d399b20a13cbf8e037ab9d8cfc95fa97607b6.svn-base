	<li>Being active doesn't always have to mean jogging or aerobics -
		gentle, everyday activities like walking, gardening and climbing
		stairs are great ways to get started</li>
	<li>Make small changes like walking rather than driving, and
		taking the stairs instead of the lift or escalator.</li>
	<li>Take a walk every day - to work, to the shop, or to see a
		friend.</li>
	<li>Set a date and take your kids, grandkids, pets or friends to
		the park.</li>
	<li>The type of activity that helps your heart most will make you
		feel warmer, breathe harder and make your heart beat faster than
		usual.</li>
	<li>Set aside some time in your week for activities like brisk
		walking, jogging, cycling, swimming, exercise classes or team sports
		like football.</li>
	<li>You can spread this out over the week however you like</li>
</ul>
<b>Remember - every ten minutes counts.</b>
