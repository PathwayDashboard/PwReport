<p align="justify">A balanced diet Everyone should aim for a
	well-balanced diet. The best way to understand it is to think of foods
	in food groups.</p>
<p align="justify">Try to eat:
<ul>
	<li>Plenty of fruit and vegetables</li>
	<li>Plenty of starchy foods such as bread, rice, potatoes and
		pasta. Choose wholegrain varieties wherever possible</li>
	<li>Some milk and dairy products</li>
	<li>Some meat, fish, eggs, beans and other non-dairy sources of
		protein</li>
	<li>Only a small amount of foods and drinks high in fats and/or

You don't need to get always the balance right at every meal, but try to
get it right over a longer time such as a whole day or week.
<b> Try to choose foods that are lower in fat, salt and sugar when
	you can.</b>
<p align="justify">
<h3>Fruit and vegetables</h3>
</p>
<p align="justify">A well-balanced diet should include at least 5
	portions of fruit and veg a day. Try to vary the types of fruit and veg
	you eat.</p>
<p align="justify">
	They can be fresh, frozen, dried or tinned. Pure unsweetened fruit
	juice, pulses and beans count as a portion, but they only make up a
	maximum of one of your five a day, however much you eat in one day. <b>A
		portion is about a handful (80g or 3oz), for examples see <a href="#"
		data-target="#imgModal2" data-toggle="modal"> pictures</a>
	</b>
</p>
<h3>Salt</h3>
<p align="justify">
	Eating too much <a

	can increase the risk of developing high blood pressure. Having high <a

<h3>Fats</h3>
<p align="justify">All fats are high in calories, so it's important
	to bear this in mind if you are watching your weight.</p>
<p align="justify">In terms of your heart, it's important to think
	about the type of fat you are eating.</p>
<p align="justify">
	A typical diet is made up of different types of fat. While you need to
	make sure you eat foods that contain healthy monounsaturated and
	polyunsaturated fats, too much saturated fat can increase the amount of
	<a
		href="https://www.bhf.org.uk/heart-health/risk-factors/high-cholesterol" target="_blank">cholesterol</a>
	in your blood, which can increase your risk of developing <a

		heart disease</a>.
</p>
<p align="justify">
	You can have a high cholesterol level even if you are a healthy weight.
	And even if your cholesterol level is healthy, it's important to <a
		href="https://www.bhf.org.uk/heart-health/preventing-heart-disease/healthy-eating" target="_blank">eat
		well</a> and to <a
