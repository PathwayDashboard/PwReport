						<h3>How much is too much?</h3>

						To stay healthy:
						<ul>
							<li>Women should not regularly drink more than 2 or 3 units
								of alcohol a day</li>
							<li>Men should not regularly drink more than 3 or 4 units of
								alcohol a day.</li>
						</ul>

						You should aim to stay within these guidelines. A little more
						alcohol on some days won't cause a healthy adult too much harm.
						But regularly drinking more than this may lead to health problems
						over time.

						<h3>Understanding units:</h3>

						<a href="#" data-target="#imgModal" data-toggle="modal"> The
							number of units in a drink</a> is worked out using the size and
						strength of the drink. Different drinks will have different units
						e.g., a glass of wine will be more units than a glass of beer of
						the same size.
