						<h3>Why should I quit?</h3>

						The chemicals in tobacco smoke can damage the lining of your
						coronary arteries - the tubes that take oxygen-rich blood to your
						heart. This can cause fatty material to build up in your arteries,
						leading them to get clogged up and blocked.
						<p align="justify">The chemicals in tobacco smoke also make
							platelets in your blood more sticky, which can cause your blood
							to form clots, which can block your arteries and cause a heart
							attack or stroke.
						<p align="justify">All this means that you're much more likely
							to develop coronary heart disease, and as a smoker, you're almost
							twice as likely to have a heart attack than your non-smoking
							friends.</p>
