						<p align="justify">What do the medicines do?</p>
						<p align="justify">Most medicines used to treat heart
							conditions change how the heart or the blood circulation works -
							a bit like a mechanic tuning an engine that is not working as
							well as it should. Several different medicines may be available
							to treat your heart condition. People are all different and it
							can be difficult to know exactly which medicine may suit you.
							Your doctor will choose the one most likely to be safe and
							effective for your condition. With the right medicines taken at
							the right doses, it is often possible to reduce the symptoms of
							heart-related conditions and help the heart to work better than
							before.</p>

								the tablet under your tongue until it dissolves.</li>
							<li><b>Aerosol spray</b> - You spray the medicine under your
								tongue</li>

							<li><b>Self-adhesive patch</b> - A patch containing your
								medicine is placed on your skin and the medicine is absorbed
								over a period of time</li>
						</ul>
