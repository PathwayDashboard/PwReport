<h3>Tips on how can I cut down?</h3>
						<i>Cutting down on how many units you're drinking can help you
							avoid health problems in the future: </i>
						<ul>
							<li>Check how many units are in your drinks</li>
							<li>Use the <a href="#" data-target="#imgModal"
								data-toggle="modal">above pictures</a> to understand what units
								are
							</li>
							<li>Look at the back of the bottle, can or container to see
								how many units are in your drink.</li>
							<li>Have a non-alcoholic drink in between your alcoholic
								drinks to space out your units.</li>
							<li>Choose drinks that are lower in alcohol.</li>
						</ul>

						<p align="justify">As well as keeping an eye on the daily
							guidelines, it's important to avoid 'binge' drinking. Drinking a
							lot (more than 15 units) in one go can affect your heart beat.</p>
