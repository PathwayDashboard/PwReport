<h3>How can I reduce the amount of units I drink?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Be aware of how many units are in your drink.</li>
	<li>Have a non-alcoholic drink (e.g., water, fizzy drink) in
		between your alcoholic drinks to space out your units.</li>
	<li>Choose drinks that are lower in alcohol This small choice can
		make a big difference.</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">As well as keeping an eye on the daily
	guidelines, it's important to avoid 'binge' drinking. Drinking a lot
	(more than 15 units) in one go can affect your heart beat.</p>
