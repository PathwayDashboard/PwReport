						Good news, you don't need to stop drinking alcohol
						completely. The effects of alcohol on one's health are presented
						in a J-shape or U-shape as they like to call it. This means that
						consuming to much alcohol has negative effects on your wellbeing,
						but complete abstinence also seems not warranted. Or in other
						words, moderate alcohol consumption can be good for your health.
						When we talk about moderate consumption we need to make some
						things clear. First you need to know what is meant with
						"moderate". This is defined in many ways, but generally taken it
						comes down to this:
						<ul>
							<li>Max. 2 units per day for men and 1 unit per day for
								women. With units, the normal serving portions are meant.</li>
							<li>In total no more than 14 units per week for men and 7
								units per week for women. You cannot consume 14 units in one
								day.</li>
						</ul>
						<p align="justify">
						Another issue is the "consumption pattern". The best pattern seems
						to be when you drink the allowed amount of alcohol every single
						day again. It is this continuous consumption pattern that is
						associated with the greatest health benefits. Drinking large
						amounts of alcohol in a short period of time, like the youngsters
						partying in the weekend, does not seem to be a great idea and even
						has detrimental effects on health. A third point of concern
						applies to the "kind of beverage" you drink. Not all alcoholic
						drinks result in health benefits when consumed moderately and
						regularly. Strong liquors for example do not contribute to your
						health. Beers and white wine only have moderate effects. The
						greatest effect is achieved by drinking red wine. The mechanisms
						are contributable to two substances present in these beverages.
						They are called polyphenols and resveratrol. These 2 substances
						are abundantly present in red wine. Lastly, in some patient groups
						(e.g. atrial fibrillation or when taking some kinds of medication)
						drinking alcohol can stay absolutely contra-indicated. <b>Always
							consult your general practitioner when in doubt!</b>

						Smoking can be viewed as a disease, killing half of the people
						suffering from it. On average, a smoker lives 10 years less in
						comparison with his or her non-smoking peers. The negative
						consequences of smoking are well known. Not only is it bad for
						your lungs, but also for your heart and other organs. Nails and
						teeth turn yellow, your breath begins to smell etc. Therefore a
						smoking cessation is a top priority in achieving better health. To
						quit smoking is very difficult for a lot of people, not only
						because you are physically addicted, but also because it has
						become a habit. How does the physical addiction work? Well, in
						tobacco there is a substance called nicotine. When you inhale this
						nicotine, it reaches your brain in 7 minutes! There, it will
						stimulate some parts of your brain that give you a pleasant,
						relaxed feeling. Because you send a lot of nicotine to your brain
						at once, it automatically assumes this will happen again and
						prepares itself to make sure it can capture all that nicotine you
						send to it. Because your brain is now prepared, the effects of a
						sudden nicotine wave will be smaller and you can only achieve the
						same relaxing sensation by smoking more. Of course this will end
						in a vicious circle of you smoking more and more. Below, you can
						find the text of a leaflet literally taken from the source
						mentioned at the end.<br>
						 <b>Why use tobacco?</b>
						<ul>
							<li>What, therefore, is the explanation for continuing
								smoking, despite so many tobacco control efforts to stop
								morbidity and mortality caused by tobacco?</li>
							<li>Can we assume that smokers have no regard for their
								health or do they imagine "this harmful effect cannot happen to
								me"?</li>
							<li>Are they not capable of realizing the harmful effects
								shown in educational materials? Or is it something else that
								makes them unable to quit smoking despite being aware of the
								dangers?</li>
							<li>Could this be the complex psycho-behavioral and physical
								changes determined by a chemical substance contained in tobacco?
								Clearly this is the case.</li>
						</ul>
						<b>Tobacco dependence</b>
						<ul>
							<li>The intensity of nicotinic dependence is very high,
								higher or similar to heroin and cocaine, much more addictive
								than alcohol, cannabis or LSD and similar drugs.</li>
							<li>Chronic tobacco use, or in simple terms "smoking", has
								been recognized by all psychiatric medical bodies as a disease
								in itself, inducing physical and psychological as a chronic
								disease, i.e. tobacco dependence or nicotine dependence.</li>
							<li>Most cigarettes are lit not by free choice but by
								dependence on nicotine, a highly addictive drug present in all
								tobacco products.</li>
							<li>Chronic tobacco exposure has been proven to cause a wide
								range of diseases and death due to the numerous toxins and
								carcinogenic compounds present in tobacco.</li>
							<li>Tobacco manufacturers use many strategies to increase
								nicotine dependence in tobacco products: additives, flavorings,
								filter characteristics etc.</li>
							<li>The tobacco industry constantly invests in new markets
								to target vulnerable categories of potential clients, i.e.
								children and young people who are the most exposed.</li>
							<li>The best method to react to the tobacco industry is to
								provide individuals with knowledge and skills based on
								scientific evidence in order to face this challenge.</li>
						</ul>

						<b>Individual implications of tobacco use</b>
						<ul>
							<li>One out of every two tobacco users will die prematurely
								as the result of a tobacco-related disease.</li>
							<li>Tobacco use is the single largest cause of preventable
								death.</li>
							<li>More than half of these deaths occur in people aged
								35-69 years.</li>
							<li>Every day around the world this number of deaths is
								equivalent to fifty jumbo jets crashing.</li>
							<li>Tobacco use accounts for: 87% of lung cancer deaths, 82%
								of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) incidences, 21%
								of CHD (coronary heart disease) incidences and 18% of stroke
								incidences.</li>
							<li>Tobacco use has been shown to cause complications during
								pregnancy.</li>
							<li>Tobacco use makes a person's breath, hair and clothes
								smell bad, causes teeth, fingernails and skin to become stained
								and causes clothes to become ruined or burnt.</li>
							<li>Tobacco use decreases athletic performance.</li>
							<li>Tobacco is a major cause of fires and accidental deaths.
							</li>
							<li>Tobacco use is a gateway to other drug use, and
								addiction to tobacco may make a person more susceptible to
								trying other dangerous drugs.</li>
						</ul>
						<b>Implications for family, friends, and co-workers of tobacco
							users</b>
						<ul>
							<li>You are exposing your family, friends and co-workers to
								environmental or second-hand tobacco smoke.</li>
							<li>Second-hand tobacco smoke increases the risk of lung
								cancer by 30%. This results in 3000 additional cases of lung
								cancer per annum.</li>
							<li>Infants and children chronically exposed to second-hand
								smoke have an increased risk of asthma, other respiratory
								diseases, malignancies and other health issues. These diseases
								result in increased hospitalizations and school absence.</li>
							<li>Exposure to tobacco smoke increases the risk of low
								birth weight babies and sudden infant death syndrome.</li>
							<li>Non-using adults exposed to second-hand smoke are also
								more likely to have respiratory diseases and symptoms that
								contribute to absenteeism from work and other activities.</li>
							<li>Spouses of smokers have a higher risk of heart disease
								and lung cancer.</li>
						</ul>
						<b>Benefits of quitting tobacco use</b>
						<ol>
							<li>Short term benefits
								<ul>
									<li>After 20 minutes blood pressure and pulse rates return
										to normal.</li>
									<li>After 8 hours carbon monoxide and oxygen levels in the
										blood return to normal.</li>
									<li>After 24 hours carbon monoxide is eliminated from the
										body; lungs start to clear out mucus and smoking debris;
										chances of a heart attack are decreased.</li>
									<li>After 48 hours no nicotine is left in the body; nerve
										endings start to re-grow; and the ability to smell and taste
										is improved.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Long-term benefits
								<ul>
									<li>Improved breathing.</li>
									<li>More physical energy.</li>
									<li>Better skin tone.</li>
									<li>Reduction in risks of tobacco-related diseases, such
										as:
										<ul>
											<li>lung cancer</li>
											<li>emphysema</li>
											<li>COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease),</li>
											<li>sudden-death heart attack,</li>
											<li>CHD (coronary heart disease),</li>
											<li>atherosclerosis (narrowing of the arteries),</li>
											<li>stroke,</li>
											<li>chronic bronchitis.</li>
											<li>Cleaner air for family and friends.</li>
											<li>Fresher smell in homes and cars.</li>
											<li>Financial savings: those who smoke one pack per day,
												spend on average US$ 1095 p.a.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ol>

						<b>Preparation to quit The better prepared to quit you are,
							the higher the likelihood of success. Some suggestions include: </b>
						<ul>
							<li>Decide positively that you want to quit.</li>
							<li>Make a list of reasons, including personal reasons,
								medical effects, health benefits, financial advantages and
								obligations to others.</li>
							<li>Repeat one of these reasons to yourself several times
								each morning.</li>
							<li>Start conditioning yourself physically with a modest
								exercise routine. Get lots of rest and drink more fluids.</li>
							<li>Set a target date for quitting within the next two
								weeks.</li>
							<li>Identify barriers to quitting. What will make it
								difficult? What situations make you desire tobacco? What can you
								do to change that?</li>
							<li>Make a list of people who can support your intentions to
								quit, such as family, friends and coworkers. Discuss your plans
								with them.</li>
							<li>If any of these people are smokers, ask them to refrain
								from using tobacco around you or, better yet, ask them to join
								you in quitting.</li>
							<li>Clear the places where you usually smoke of anything
								that would remind you of cigarettes - like lighters, ashtrays or
								matches.</li>
							<li>Clean your house and car; try to remove the smell of
								smoke as much as possible.</li>
							<li>Make a list of activities, hobbies, and interests that
								you can do to keep your mind off smoking.</li>
							<li>Prepare yourself with knowledge about the withdrawal
								symptoms and ways to cope with them.</li>
							<li>Be prepared to face difficult quitting. Learn about
								"withdrawal syndrome".</li>
							<li>Nicotine withdrawal consists of symptoms due to suddenly
								stopping the nicotine supply. Nicotine withdrawal can manifest
								from the very first 4-12 hours since smoking cessation, through
								symptoms like:
								<ul>
									<li>acute/uncontrollable need to smoke (craving);</li>
									<li>irritability;</li>
									<li>restlessness, anger, anxiety feelings;</li>
									<li>tiredness;</li>
									<li>high appetite, especially for sweets, weight gain;</li>
									<li>troubles to concentrate/memory troubles;</li>
									<li>depression;</li>
									<li>headaches;</li>
									<li>insomnia;</li>
									<li>dizziness.</li>
								</ul>
						</ul>
						<b>Therapies that help to quit smoking</b>
						<ul>
							<li>The two components that have proven efficient in
								treating tobacco dependence are: counseling and pharmacotherapy.</li>
							<li>Pharmacological therapy is crucial and it comprises a
								generous offer of medications, from nicotine substitutes used in
								various forms (gum, patch, nasal spray, inhaler, sublingual
								tablet), to anti-depressants, nicotine receptor antagonists etc.</li>
							<li>You must ask your physician or pharmacist to prescribe
								or recommend medication to quit smoking.</li>
							<li>Combination of various pharmacological therapies can be
								used with the help of health professionals, the therapy duration
								can be extended, and dosages can be adjusted to avoid side
								effects.</li>
							<li>Leaflets, posters, brochures, different educational and
								self-help written or media materials, together with Internet
								tools or phone lines may help.</li>
							<li>CBT is a therapeutic technique that attempts to change
								habitual ways of thinking and feeling about smoking and oneself
								and provides encouragement and advice on ways of minimizing and
								managing the desire to smoke.</li>
							<li>Optimally, individual smoking cessation strategies
								combine advice (a recommendation to quit smoking) with
								pharmacological treatment (varenicline, bupropion, NRT etc.) and
								with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).</li>

<p align="justify">
						What is stress? First it is important to note that stress is
						something of all ages. A very long time ago, when mankind still
						lived in caves, stress occurred when we were threatened by danger.
						As a normal reaction to this danger a lot of things happen in our
						body. Our heartbeat accelerates, our breathing intensifies, blood
						pressure rises, adrenaline and cortisol levels climb etc... This
						resulted in a reaction consisting of fighting the danger or
						running away from it, also called the fight-or-flight response.
						Then, when the threat was eliminated, everything went back to
						normal and the stress-level decreased again. This reaction is
						still present when we find ourselves in immediate danger and
						generally causes no long lasting discomfort. However, nowadays we
						don't find ourselves that often in those acute situations. Rather,
						we find ourselves in situations that "agitate" us for longer
						periods of time, like weeks or months. These small "agitations"
						can be caused by familial or social problems, a huge workload at
						work, etc. Thus, rendering in a small but long-lasting
						stress-response with elevated hormone levels. These elevated
						hormone levels eventually will cause physical symptoms and can
						lead to heart and vessel problems. It is still a common
						misconception that stress is something that is only inside your
						head. From the previous paragraphs it may be clear that mental
						stress indeed can cause bodily complaints. Because stress links
						the brain and the body with each other, both entities can be used
						to reduce stress. When trying to reduce stress it is important to
						do this with a method you like. If you use a method you don't
						like, or you perceive this type of effort to be a burden, than
						this will only lead to more stress. Below are a couple of methods
						that are proven effective in reducing stress levels.
						<ul>
							<li>It is important to identify in a very specific manner
								the cause of your stress. Maybe when you think about it, the
								actual cause isn't that big a problem to solve.</li>
							<li>Relaxation techniques. Some forms of relaxation are
								offered in the PATHway platform. Feel free to try them out,
								maybe one of them suits you well!</li>
							<li>Behavioral training such as time management. Keeping
								things organized and well planned may give you more certainty
								about what you are doing.</li>
							<li>Physical Exercise. Use your body as a gate towards your
								brain. While doing exercise hormones are released that
								counteract the stress-hormones or help them get back in balance.
								PATHway offers you exercise adapted to your level.</li>
							<li>When you really feel helpless or your environment has
								already brought to your attention that professionals might help
								you better, please contact your general practitioner for a talk
								and see if you can be referred to a specialist.</li>
