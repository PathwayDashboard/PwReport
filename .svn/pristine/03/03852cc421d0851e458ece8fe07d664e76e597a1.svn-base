</h5>
You don't need to get always the balance right at every meal, but try to
get it right over a longer time such as a whole day or week.
<b> Try to choose foods that are lower in fat, salt and sugar when
	you can.</b>
<p align="justify">
<h3>Fruit and vegetables</h3>
</p>
<p align="justify">A well-balanced diet should include at least 5
	portions of fruit and veg a day. Try to vary the types of fruit and veg
	you eat.</p>
<p align="justify">
	They can be fresh, frozen, dried or tinned. Pure unsweetened fruit
	juice, pulses and beans count as a portion, but they only make up a
	maximum of one of your five a day, however much you eat in one day. <b>A
		portion is about a handful (80g or 3oz), for examples see <a href="#"

<h3>Salt</h3>
<p align="justify">
	Eating too much <a

		target="_blank">salt</a> can increase the risk of developing high
	blood pressure.
	Try and avoid salty foods. Often times processed foods can contain higher levels of salt-always check labels. Avoid adding any extra salt to foods as you will get enough salt naturally from your diet. </p>

<h3>Fats</h3>
<p align="justify">All fats are high in calories, so it's important
	to bear this in mind if you are watching your weight.</p>
<p align="justify">Fat is important for your health too though, it is just about what type of fat you eat.</p>
<p align="justify">
	You need to make sure you eat foods that contain healthy monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats
</p>
<p align="justify">
	But too much saturated fat can increase your cholesterol levels.
