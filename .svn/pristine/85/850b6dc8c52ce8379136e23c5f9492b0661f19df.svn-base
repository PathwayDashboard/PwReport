					<p align="justify">What is stress? First it is important to
						note that stress is something of all ages. A very long time ago,
						when mankind still lived in caves, stress occurred when we were
						threatened by danger. As a normal reaction to this danger a lot of
						things happen in our body. Our heartbeat accelerates, our
						breathing intensifies, blood pressure rises, adrenaline and
						cortisol levels climb etc... This resulted in a reaction
						consisting of fighting the danger or running away from it, also
						called the fight-or-flight response. Then, when the threat was
						eliminated, everything went back to normal and the stress-level
						decreased again. This reaction is still present when we find
						ourselves in immediate danger and generally causes no long lasting
						discomfort. However, nowadays we don't find ourselves that often
						in those acute situations. Rather, we find ourselves in situations
						that "agitate" us for longer periods of time, like weeks or
						months. These small "agitations" can be caused by familial or
						social problems, a huge workload at work, etc. Thus, rendering in
						a small but long-lasting stress-response with elevated hormone
						levels. These elevated hormone levels eventually will cause
						physical symptoms and can lead to heart and vessel problems. It is
						still a common misconception that stress is something that is only
						inside your head. From the previous paragraphs it may be clear
						that mental stress indeed can cause bodily complaints. Because
						stress links the brain and the body with each other, both entities
						can be used to reduce stress. When trying to reduce stress it is
						important to do this with a method you like. If you use a method
						you don't like, or you perceive this type of effort to be a
						burden, than this will only lead to more stress. Below are a
						couple of methods that are proven effective in reducing stress
						levels.
					<ul>
						<li>It is important to identify in a very specific manner the
							cause of your stress. Maybe when you think about it, the actual
							cause isn't that big a problem to solve.</li>
						<li>Relaxation techniques. Some forms of relaxation are
							offered in the PATHway platform. Feel free to try them out, maybe
							one of them suits you well!</li>
						<li>Behavioral training such as time management. Keeping
							things organized and well planned may give you more certainty
							about what you are doing.</li>
						<li>Physical Exercise. Use your body as a gate towards your
							brain. While doing exercise hormones are released that counteract
							the stress-hormones or help them get back in balance. PATHway
							offers you exercise adapted to your level.</li>
						<li>When you really feel helpless or your environment has
							already brought to your attention that professionals might help
							you better, please contact your general practitioner for a talk
							and see if you can be referred to a specialist.</li>
					</ul>
