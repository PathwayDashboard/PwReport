	<li>Being active doesn't have to mean you need to be sporty or go to the gym- gentle, everyday activities count to. Walking, gardening and cleaning around the house can be a good place to start.</li>
	<li>Make small changes like walking rather than driving-even if you have to drive you can try and park further from your destination. Try taking the stairs too-you will be surprised how it adds up!</li>
	<li>Try to limit time spent sitting in long stretches- make sure to take a walk every day â€“ to work, to the shop, or to see a friend</li>
	<li>Heart Healthy activities will will make you feel warmer, breathe harder and make your heart beat faster than usual. This is a normal part of exercise and nothing to worry about</li>
	<li>If you make a specific plan for activity you are more likely to achieve your physical activity goal. Think about how often you want to exercise, what type of exercise you would like to do and how long you will spend. </li>
	<li>Try and reach you 150 minutes- You can spread this out over the week however you like</li>
</ul>
<b>Remember - being active in even small ways is better than nothing-even ten minute bouts can help!</b>
