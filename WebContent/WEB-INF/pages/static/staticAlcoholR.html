<h3>What are the recommendations?</h3>

To stay healthy:
<ul>
	<li>Women should not regularly drink more than 2 or 3 units of
		alcohol a day</li>
	<li>Men should not regularly drink more than 3 or 4 units of
		alcohol a day.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Understanding units:</h3>

<a href="#" data-target="#imgModal" data-toggle="modal"> The number
	of units in a drink</a>
is worked out using the size and strength of the drink. Different drinks
will have different units e.g., a glass of wine will be more units than
a glass of beer of the same size.
